## üí° Problem-Solving Approach
1. **Understand** the problem statement  
2. **Plan** an optimal solution (think before you code)  
3. **Code** the solution in Python (or your preferred language)  
4. **Test** thoroughly with multiple test cases  
5. **Optimize** for better time & space complexity  
6. **Document** your approach (add comments or a docstring)
